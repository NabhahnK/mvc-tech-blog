  ## Description

  ![Blog](./assets/mvcblog.PNG "Blog")

  I wanted to build a full-Stack blog. It gave me practice with express routes and mySQL models. It lets people talk to each other and comment on their posts. I learned a lot and to double check fetch routes.

  I have also deployed it as a [Heroku app](https://mvc-style-blog.herokuapp.com/).
